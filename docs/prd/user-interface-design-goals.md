# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a developer-friendly content automation dashboard that balances technical control with streamlined workflow efficiency. The interface should feel like a modern development tool (similar to VS Code or GitHub Desktop) rather than a traditional content management system, emphasizing clear information hierarchy, rapid decision-making capabilities, and transparent system state visibility. Primary design philosophy centers on "local-first with global polish" - sophisticated functionality delivered through clean, responsive interfaces optimized for desktop-first development workflow.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Pipeline Visualization:** Clear visual representation of content moving through Reddit discovery → script generation → asset review → video rendering stages with real-time status indicators
- **Quick Approval Workflows:** Card-based interfaces with single-click approve/reject actions, keyboard shortcuts for power users, and bulk operations for efficient content curation
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex details (full scripts, asset galleries, technical logs) accessible through expandable sections or modal overlays without cluttering primary workflow views
- **Real-time Synchronization:** WebSocket-driven updates showing processing status, queue positions, and completion notifications without page refreshes
- **Developer-Centric Navigation:** Command palette integration (Cmd/Ctrl+K), breadcrumb navigation, and quick-access sidebar for technical users familiar with modern development environments

## Core Screens and Views

- **Content Discovery Dashboard:** Primary interface displaying scraped Reddit posts with scoring data, filtering capabilities, and batch approval actions
- **Script Review Interface:** Detailed script editing and approval workflow with version comparison, keyword highlighting, and scene breakdown visualization
- **Asset Review Gallery:** Visual asset management showing Pexels search results, manual replacement interface, and quality preview capabilities
- **Video Processing Monitor:** Real-time rendering progress with detailed logs, error reporting, and completion notifications
- **System Configuration Panel:** Local settings management, API key configuration, and performance monitoring for technical users

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure full keyboard navigation for all workflow actions, high contrast ratios for status indicators and approval buttons, screen reader compatibility for content descriptions and system states, alternative text for all visual assets and video previews, and focus management for modal interfaces and progressive disclosure elements.

## Branding

Adopt clean, modern developer tool aesthetic emphasizing functionality over decoration. Use monospace fonts for technical content (logs, API responses, configuration), clean sans-serif for UI elements, and consistent color coding for status states (green for approved, yellow for pending, red for errors). Maintain GitHub-inspired dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection, emphasizing professional productivity over flashy design elements.

## Target Device and Platforms: Desktop First

Primary focus on desktop development workflow with mobile responsive design deferred to post-MVP phase. Interface optimized for modern desktop browsers with full keyboard navigation, multi-monitor support, and developer tool integration patterns familiar to technical users.
