# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

• Reduce feature development time from weeks to days through simplified local-first architecture
• Achieve <2 hours monthly maintenance vs. previous system's weekly debugging requirements  
• Enable complete system setup in <30 minutes with modern tooling and single command deployment
• Eliminate recurring operational costs while maintaining core Reddit-to-video pipeline functionality
• Process 1-3 videos daily with <10 minutes active oversight per video through streamlined workflow
• Maintain >95% video completion success rate with simple error recovery mechanisms
• Achieve 80% relevant Pexels asset matching through intelligent keyword extraction and manual review gates

## Background Context

This PRD addresses the over-engineering lessons learned from a previous Reddit-to-Video automation system that became operationally unsustainable due to complex cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud Run, Redis clusters, Bull Queue monitoring). While functionally successful, the system required more maintenance time than it saved in content creation, with 25+ interconnected components causing development friction.

The simplified approach leverages modern JavaScript tooling (Node.js 20+, TypeScript 5+, Vite) and local-first architecture to achieve core automation value without operational overhead. The refined workflow processes Reddit posts through Claude-generated scripts, Pexels asset integration, and Remotion video generation, targeting technical creators who value maintainable, customizable solutions over managed SaaS platforms.
