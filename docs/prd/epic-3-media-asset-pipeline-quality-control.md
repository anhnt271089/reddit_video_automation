# Epic 3: Media Asset Pipeline & Quality Control

**Epic Goal:** Create intelligent Pexels integration for video and image asset matching based on extracted keywords, implement comprehensive asset review interface with manual replacement capabilities, and integrate professional text-to-speech generation with precise timing extraction for audio-visual synchronization.

## Story 3.1: Pexels Asset Discovery & Intelligent Matching System

As a **video producer**,  
I want **automated Pexels asset search that finds relevant videos and images matching script themes and keywords**,  
so that **each video segment has appropriate, engaging background media without manual asset searching and curation**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Pexels API integration with rate limiting compliance (200 requests/hour free tier) and request throttling
2. Intelligent asset search using extracted keywords, quotes, and emotional themes from script breakdown
3. Asset preference algorithm prioritizing videos over images (4:1 ratio) for enhanced viewer engagement
4. Relevance scoring system evaluating asset-to-content match quality with minimum 70% threshold
5. Fallback keyword hierarchy (specific → category → generic → motivational stock) ensuring asset availability
6. Local asset caching system storing frequently used media to reduce API calls and improve performance
7. Asset metadata tracking including Pexels ID, photographer attribution, resolution, duration, and usage rights

## Story 3.2: Asset Review Interface & Manual Quality Control

As a **quality control reviewer**,  
I want **comprehensive asset preview and replacement interface ensuring visual content meets professional standards**,  
so that **I can review, approve, or replace assets before video generation while maintaining content relevance and quality**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Visual asset gallery displaying all selected Pexels content with preview capabilities and scene context
2. Side-by-side comparison showing script segment alongside corresponding visual asset with relevance scoring
3. Asset replacement workflow enabling manual search and selection of alternative Pexels content
4. Batch preview functionality allowing sequential review of all assets with approve/replace decisions
5. Asset quality indicators showing resolution, duration, visual composition, and professional rating scores
6. Manual upload capability for custom assets when Pexels content insufficient for specific scenes
7. Asset approval tracking preventing video generation until all visual content receives explicit approval

## Story 3.3: Professional Voice Generation & Audio Processing

As a **video producer**,  
I want **high-quality text-to-speech generation with precise timing data for perfect audio-visual synchronization**,  
so that **videos have professional narration perfectly aligned with typography animations and scene transitions**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. ElevenLabs API integration for professional voice synthesis with natural emotional pacing
2. Adjustable video duration configuration affecting narration speed, pause timing, and overall script pacing
3. Word-level timing extraction from TTS output enabling precise Remotion keyframe synchronization
4. Audio segmentation matching script sentence boundaries with natural pause insertion and crossfade preparation
5. Voice selection interface offering multiple narrator profiles optimized for motivational content delivery
6. Audio quality validation ensuring consistent levels, clear articulation, and professional broadcast standards
7. Backup TTS integration (Web Speech API) providing local fallback when ElevenLabs unavailable

## Story 3.4: Asset-Audio Synchronization & Timing Optimization

As a **video producer**,  
I want **precise coordination between visual assets, narration timing, and script content for professional video quality**,  
so that **background media transitions align with speech patterns and content emotional flow without jarring cuts**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Timing analysis calculating optimal asset duration based on corresponding narration segments
2. Transition point detection identifying natural breaks for smooth asset changes during speech pauses
3. Asset duration optimization ensuring visual content spans appropriate narration segments without repetition
4. Scene boundary synchronization aligning asset transitions with script emotional beats and topic changes
5. Audio-visual gap detection identifying timing mismatches requiring manual adjustment or asset replacement
6. Preview generation creating short test clips validating synchronization accuracy before full video rendering
7. Timing adjustment interface allowing fine-tuning of asset placement and transition points post-generation

## Story 3.5: Media Pipeline Error Handling & Recovery

As a **system administrator**,  
I want **robust error handling and recovery mechanisms for all external API dependencies and media processing**,  
so that **temporary failures don't derail video production and assets can be recovered or replaced efficiently**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. API failure detection and retry logic with exponential backoff for Pexels and ElevenLabs services
2. Asset processing validation ensuring downloaded content matches expected format, quality, and duration specifications
3. Alternative asset selection when primary Pexels searches fail (fallback keywords, generic motivational content)
4. Partial completion handling allowing approved assets to proceed while failed components await manual intervention
5. Comprehensive error logging with context (API response, request parameters, retry attempts) for debugging
6. Asset integrity verification preventing corrupted or incomplete media from entering video generation pipeline
7. Recovery workflow enabling resumed processing from last successful checkpoint without complete restart
