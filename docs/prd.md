# Simplified Reddit-to-Video Automation Workflow Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• Reduce feature development time from weeks to days through simplified local-first architecture
• Achieve <2 hours monthly maintenance vs. previous system's weekly debugging requirements  
• Enable complete system setup in <30 minutes with modern tooling and single command deployment
• Eliminate recurring operational costs while maintaining core Reddit-to-video pipeline functionality
• Process 1-3 videos daily with <10 minutes active oversight per video through streamlined workflow
• Maintain >95% video completion success rate with simple error recovery mechanisms
• Achieve 80% relevant Pexels asset matching through intelligent keyword extraction and manual review gates

### Background Context

This PRD addresses the over-engineering lessons learned from a previous Reddit-to-Video automation system that became operationally unsustainable due to complex cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud Run, Redis clusters, Bull Queue monitoring). While functionally successful, the system required more maintenance time than it saved in content creation, with 25+ interconnected components causing development friction.

The simplified approach leverages modern JavaScript tooling (Node.js 20+, TypeScript 5+, Vite) and local-first architecture to achieve core automation value without operational overhead. The refined workflow processes Reddit posts through Claude-generated scripts, Pexels asset integration, and Remotion video generation, targeting technical creators who value maintainable, customizable solutions over managed SaaS platforms.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a developer-friendly content automation dashboard that balances technical control with streamlined workflow efficiency. The interface should feel like a modern development tool (similar to VS Code or GitHub Desktop) rather than a traditional content management system, emphasizing clear information hierarchy, rapid decision-making capabilities, and transparent system state visibility. Primary design philosophy centers on "local-first with global polish" - sophisticated functionality delivered through clean, responsive interfaces optimized for desktop-first development workflow.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Pipeline Visualization:** Clear visual representation of content moving through Reddit discovery → script generation → asset review → video rendering stages with real-time status indicators
- **Quick Approval Workflows:** Card-based interfaces with single-click approve/reject actions, keyboard shortcuts for power users, and bulk operations for efficient content curation
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex details (full scripts, asset galleries, technical logs) accessible through expandable sections or modal overlays without cluttering primary workflow views
- **Real-time Synchronization:** WebSocket-driven updates showing processing status, queue positions, and completion notifications without page refreshes
- **Developer-Centric Navigation:** Command palette integration (Cmd/Ctrl+K), breadcrumb navigation, and quick-access sidebar for technical users familiar with modern development environments

### Core Screens and Views

- **Content Discovery Dashboard:** Primary interface displaying scraped Reddit posts with scoring data, filtering capabilities, and batch approval actions
- **Script Review Interface:** Detailed script editing and approval workflow with version comparison, keyword highlighting, and scene breakdown visualization
- **Asset Review Gallery:** Visual asset management showing Pexels search results, manual replacement interface, and quality preview capabilities
- **Video Processing Monitor:** Real-time rendering progress with detailed logs, error reporting, and completion notifications
- **System Configuration Panel:** Local settings management, API key configuration, and performance monitoring for technical users

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure full keyboard navigation for all workflow actions, high contrast ratios for status indicators and approval buttons, screen reader compatibility for content descriptions and system states, alternative text for all visual assets and video previews, and focus management for modal interfaces and progressive disclosure elements.

### Branding

Adopt clean, modern developer tool aesthetic emphasizing functionality over decoration. Use monospace fonts for technical content (logs, API responses, configuration), clean sans-serif for UI elements, and consistent color coding for status states (green for approved, yellow for pending, red for errors). Maintain GitHub-inspired dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection, emphasizing professional productivity over flashy design elements.

### Target Device and Platforms: Desktop First

Primary focus on desktop development workflow with mobile responsive design deferred to post-MVP phase. Interface optimized for modern desktop browsers with full keyboard navigation, multi-monitor support, and developer tool integration patterns familiar to technical users.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision:** Single repository with pnpm workspaces containing `/app` (React frontend), `/server` (Node.js backend), `/shared` (TypeScript types), and `/templates` (Remotion components)

**Rationale:** Simplified dependency management, atomic deployments, and shared TypeScript types across all components. Enables rapid iteration with single command setup while maintaining clear separation of concerns for different system components.

### Service Architecture

**Architecture Pattern:** Single-process local development with event-driven processing

- **Core Processing:** Node.js 20+ with Fastify 4+ for high-performance API endpoints and WebSocket support
- **Frontend:** Vite + React 18 + TypeScript 5+ for fast development cycles and hot module replacement
- **Database:** SQLite with better-sqlite3 for development, PostgreSQL for production scaling
- **Video Processing:** Remotion 4+ for React-based programmatic video generation
- **State Management:** Zustand for lightweight, TypeScript-native frontend state without Redux complexity

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy:** Pragmatic testing pyramid focusing on critical path validation

- **Unit Testing:** Vitest for both frontend and backend components with emphasis on core business logic
- **Integration Testing:** API endpoint testing with actual database integration using Vitest + Supertest
- **Manual Testing Convenience:** Built-in development tools for rapid workflow testing and debugging
- **No E2E Initially:** Focus on reliable unit and integration coverage for MVP, add Playwright later if needed

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Development Environment:**

- **Package Management:** pnpm for faster installation and better disk efficiency compared to npm/yarn
- **Build Tooling:** Vite for frontend with sub-second hot reload, nodemon for backend auto-restart
- **TypeScript Configuration:** Strict mode with end-to-end type safety from database queries to UI components
- **Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier with modern TypeScript rules, avoid complex configuration overhead

**External Integrations:**

- **Reddit API:** Direct fetch() calls with OAuth2 authentication and built-in rate limiting
- **Claude Integration:** Direct API calls leveraging existing Claude Code subscription, no service abstraction
- **Pexels API:** RESTful integration with local caching strategy and keyword-based search optimization
- **Text-to-Speech:** ElevenLabs API primary, Web Speech API fallback for local processing option

**Database Strategy:**

- **Development:** SQLite with synchronous operations for simplicity and file-based backup/version control
- **Schema Management:** Plain SQL migration files without ORM complexity, direct query execution
- **Production Scaling:** PostgreSQL compatibility maintained through standard SQL patterns

**Deployment & Operations:**

- **Local Development:** Single command startup (npm install && npm start) with automatic dependency resolution
- **Configuration Management:** Environment variables with .env files, no external configuration services
- **Error Handling:** Structured logging with Winston, console output for development, file logging for production
- **Process Management:** Simple process restart for error recovery, no complex orchestration requirements
