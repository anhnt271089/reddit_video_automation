# Story 3.1: Content Discovery Dashboard

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content curator,  
**I want** an intuitive dashboard to review and approve discovered Reddit posts,  
**so that** I can efficiently select high-quality content for video creation with clear visibility into post metrics and pipeline status.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard displays Reddit posts in responsive card layout with key metrics
2. Real-time WebSocket updates show new posts and status changes without page refresh
3. Filtering system allows sorting by score, date, status, and upvotes
4. Batch approval actions enable efficient multi-post selection
5. Post cards show title, excerpt, engagement metrics, and quality score
6. Approval workflow updates database state and triggers script generation
7. Infinite scroll or pagination handles large numbers of posts efficiently
8. Search functionality finds posts by title or content keywords
9. Visual indicators clearly show post status throughout pipeline

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management:** Zustand store with selectors
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **Real-time:** WebSocket connection to backend
- **Performance:** React Window for virtualization

### Component Hierarchy

```
ContentReview/
├── Dashboard Header
├── PostFilters
│   ├── Sort Controls
│   ├── Status Filter
│   └── Search Input
├── BatchActions
└── PostGrid
    └── PostCard[]
```

### WebSocket Events

Listen for these events from backend:

- `posts_discovered`: New posts added
- `post_status_update`: Status changes
- `batch_update_complete`: Batch operations finished

### Post Card Design

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ [Score] Title...            │
│ Content excerpt...          │
│ 👍 upvotes 💬 comments     │
│ u/author • 2h ago           │
│ [Approve] [Reject] [More]   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### State Structure

```typescript
interface PostsState {
  items: RedditPost[];
  loading: boolean;
  filters: PostFilters;
  selectedIds: string[];
  searchQuery: string;
  sortBy: SortOption;
}
```

### Testing Standards

- Component testing with React Testing Library
- WebSocket message handling tests
- Filter and search functionality tests
- Batch action integration tests
- Performance testing with large datasets
