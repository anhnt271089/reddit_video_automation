# Sprint 005: Asset Search Matching Optimization

## Epic Overview

**Epic Title:** Pexels Asset Search Matching Optimization  
**Epic ID:** EPIC-005  
**Sprint:** 005  
**Duration:** 2 weeks

### Epic Goal

Optimize asset search and matching capabilities to ensure generated video scripts produce highly relevant, contextually appropriate visual content from Pexels API that enhances story narrative and viewer engagement.

### Epic Description

**Current State:**
The system generates approved scripts with breakdown sentences but lacks intelligent asset search optimization. Current Pexels integration may return generic or poorly matched visual assets that don't enhance the narrative impact.

**Desired State:**
Implement advanced keyword extraction, semantic search optimization, and contextual matching to ensure each script sentence retrieves the most relevant and impactful visual assets from Pexels, creating cohesive and engaging video content.

**Business Value:**

- Improved video quality and viewer engagement through better visual storytelling
- Enhanced content relevance and professional appearance
- Reduced manual review time for asset selection
- Higher content production efficiency
